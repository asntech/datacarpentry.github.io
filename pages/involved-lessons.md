To learn more about how The Carpentries develops its lessons, please refer to the [Curriculum Development Handbook](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/).

We are always in the process of developing content for new domains and topics.
If you are interested in participating, please apply for a hackathon,
help develop on line, [get in touch](https://carpentries.org/contact/) or see our [lessons under
development](/lessons/#materials-in-early-development).

All of our lessons are collaboratively developed and distributed under the
[CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) license. We welcome
contributions!

Fix a typo, suggest a new module or add features to topics. We have a
[discussion forum](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/) and a [Slack organization](http://slack-invite.carpentries.org/) for discussion of
topics or teaching strategies. If comments or suggestions are directly
related to lesson content, please also feel free to file a GitHub issue.
